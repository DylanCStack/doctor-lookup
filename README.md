###Authored by Dylan Stackhouse, 3/17/17.
##Description
A website which allows you to lookup doctors in your area(or any specified area) who treat certain conditions/types of afflictions. This is done by searching for symptoms/issues.
##Requirements
* node.js
##Setup
1. Clone or download the project from [github](https://github.com/DylanCStack/doctor-lookup).
2. Navigate to the project root and run the command $ `npm install`. This will install all back-end dependencies.
3. When that finishes, run the command $ `bower install`. This will install all front-end dependencies.
4. When that finishes, run the command $ `gulp serve`. This will compile all code into a browser readable format, start a local server, and open index.html in your default web browser.
